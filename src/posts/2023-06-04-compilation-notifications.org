title: Notify When Compilation Buffers Finish
author: Peter Stuart
---

I often compile projects in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] using ~project-compile~, and then don't notice that they finished because the compilation window is no longer visible, so I added the following code to my config. It adds a hook to ~compilation-mode~ which alerts me when compilation finishes, only if the compilation buffer is not visible in a focused frame. It requires the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/alert][alert]] package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ps/buffer-visible-in-focused-frame-p (buffer)
    "Return t if BUFFER is visible in the focused frame, or nil otherwise."
    (let ((windows (get-buffer-window-list buffer nil t)))
      (cl-some (lambda (window)
                 (and (window-live-p window)
                      (frame-focus-state (window-frame window))))
               windows)))

  (defun ps/compilation-finish-alert (buffer result)
    "Alert the user when a compilation buffer finishes.

  If the compilation buffer is visible in the focused frame, the
  user will not be alerted."
    (unless (ps/buffer-visible-in-focused-frame-p buffer)
      (alert (format "Compilation %s" result)
             :id (format "ps/compilation-finish-alert-" (buffer-name buffer))
             :never-persist t
             :buffer buffer)))

  (add-hook 'compilation-finish-functions 'ps/compilation-finish-alert)
#+end_src
