title: Fixing 1Password on NixOS/Wayland with Nvidia Graphics
author: Peter Stuart

I'm running Wayland on NixOS using Nvidia graphics. [[https://1password.com/][1Password]][fn:1password-package] is not compatible by default with that setup and starts up with a black window:

1Password support [[https://1password.community/discussion/comment/624768][suggests]] running 1Password with the ~--disable-gpu-sandbox~ option, which works from the command line, but to use that option when launching 1Password with the [[https://www.gnome.org/][GNOME]] launcher, we need to edit the ~.desktop~ file that's included with the package. Since that file is immutable in NixOS, I wrote an [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays][overlay]][fn:overlay] for the ~_1password-gui~ package which overrides that file.

In my [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]][fn:home-manager] config:

#+begin_src nix
  nixpkgs.overlays = [ (import ./overlays/1password.nix) ];
#+end_src

... and in ~overlays/1password.nix~:

#+begin_src nix
  final: prev: {
    _1password-gui = prev._1password-gui.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: {
      postInstall = (oldAttrs.postInstall or "") + ''
        substituteInPlace $out/share/applications/1password.desktop \
          --replace "Exec=1password" "Exec=1password --disable-gpu-sandbox"
      '';
    });
  }
#+end_src

We can see the result of the override by inspecting ~~/.nix-profile/share/applications/1password.desktop~, which is symlinked to the ~.desktop~ file in the Nix store.

#+begin_src ini
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=1Password
  Exec=1password --disable-gpu-sandbox %U
  Terminal=false
  Type=Application
  Icon=1password
  StartupWMClass=1Password
  Comment=Password manager and secure wallet
  MimeType=x-scheme-handler/onepassword;
  Categories=Office;
#+end_src

The file looks correct and 1Password works after being launched from the GNOME launcher:[fn:killall]

[fn:1password-package] Available in the ~_1password-gui~ package.
[fn:overlay] Based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/scf0ui/comment/hu6xfn8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button][a comment]] in the NixOS subreddit.
[fn:home-manager] You should be able to do something similar if you are using NixOS to install 1Password for the entire system, instead of using home-manager.
[fn:killall] 1Password doesn't quit when the window is closed, so if you already have an instance running without the necessary option, you may need to ~killall 1password~ to shut it down before launching it again.
